# Windows

	The program was developed with the assistance of CodeBlocks IDE. To generate the executable on the platform, 
just open the project file - Labirinto.cbp in CodeBlocks and have compile / build the project. In the IDE will 
own the means of implementing the output file, but the project folder you can also locate the *.exe. 
 
# Linux 

	To build the program on the Linux platform, you need some libraries installed on your system. Among them is 
valid highlight of OpenGL and audio (ALUT and OpenAL). In the folder where the source files, you can find the 
makefile. In the terminal, just run the command "make run" in the directory containing the makefile to compile 
the files and start the program correctly. If any of the required libraries are not installed, it will be seen 
the list of warnings/errors, guiding which library should be installed. It is valid to remember that to install 
the libraries for this purpose on the Linux platform, you should seek the names with the suffix "-dev", thereby 
ensuring that the necessary files will be installed. The compilation will be done on silent mode.

## Example of compiling

@$ make@	
	
	
# Mac OS 

	Similar to the steps on the Linux system, the user must run the command "make run" in the directory containing 
the makefile to compile the files and start the program correctly.
